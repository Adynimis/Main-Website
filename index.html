    <section class="about-me">

      <p id="aboutme-p">&nbsp Hi! My name is Dakota. I am from Kenai, Alaska so I may be cold, but I'm fired up!
         I began learning coding when I was 13 years old and had no internet, only an old PC
         and HTML/CSS for Dummies book.
         <br>
         <br>
         &nbsp As of now I am working towards becoming a fully fledged Front-End Web Dev
         and within the next 2 years become a Full-Stack Web Dev. I love finding creative solutions
         to problems and think that is my favorite thing about coding.
         <br>
         <br>
         &nbsp If any employers see this page currently, know that this is a WIP and a platform for me to
         explore code, optimizations, and scripting as I continue learning. If you have any questions,
         feel free to contact me using the link, or fill out my form linked here.
