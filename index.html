          Ive started my coding journey at 14 where I got an old vanilla HTML/CSS for dummies book. Since then I have expanded my knowledge
          in coding by dabbling in server-side code like <strong>Python, and Javascript</strong>. Along my path I worked with
          more Object Oriented Programming(OOP) languages like <strong>C#</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>.
          I like to prioritize my time while coding helping small businesses grow their brand and reach by creating a
          rich and interactive website thant meets their needs.

          One of my favorite hobbie/side-businesses is doing device repair. Phones, Tablets, Desktops, Laptops, etc... Not only is it fun, but it
          encourages more creative problem solving as well as attention to detail. When a customer comes to me with an issue, I am expected to diagnose AND solve the issue.
          From doing a simple screen replacement on a Smartphone, to diagnosing and fixing issues pertaining to corrupted files and viruses. All self taught
          through trial and error.

          My thought proccess for creative thinking is fairly simple to me. Lets find the issue, and work backwards from that. Lets get the solution working first
          in concept/prototype, then move on to refining it to a more permenant and optimized solution. In the field of tech, we continue to stive for optimization,
          thats how we can have the same space in a device, or the same results in code, but by optimizing it further, we can improve: efficiency,
          power, and flexability i our projects.
